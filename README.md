# steppxx-piuio-fix

This is a DLL that you can load into StepPXX to fix it's broken native light driver.

Just download it from releases (or compile it and name it 'HID.dll') and place it next to StepPXX's executable. Should work with StepPrime too.

I recommend using vcpkg to install MinHook. Otherwise, you'll need to get it manually.
